## Requirements
* GNU C/C++ compiler (Clang not tested, MSVC works limited)
* CMake Version `3.8+`

If you want to use this project on Windows you can configure [WSL on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).


## Setup
We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools&ssr=false#overview) and [C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) extension as text editor. Before we can start you have to configure CMake Tools [Getting Started](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/vscode-cmake-tools/getting_started.html).

Type in the command pallette (`STRG + Shift + P`) of VS Code.
```
> CMake: Quick Start
```

## Build
### VS Code
Build a specific executable type in the command pallette:
```
> CMake: Build Target
```
now you can select the executable you want to build. To Build all executable:
```
> CMake: Build
```

Executable is located in the `build` folder. For more details please read the official documentation of [CMake Tools: Building](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/vscode-cmake-tools/building.html).


### CMake cli

``` bash
$ cd Project_Dir/Assignment[N]
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
